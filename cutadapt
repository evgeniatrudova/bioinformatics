OUTPUT:  
R1. Cleaned Forward Reads Adapters removed, low-quality ends cut off, short fragments deleted.
R2. Cleaned Reverse Reads. Match to R1 clean.
sample1_trim_report.txt  Sanity TXT.How many reads were processed and what percentage had adapters.

Expected results for R2 trimming for UMI: 
INPUT: Paired end FASTAQ files 
OUTPUT:  
R1. Same as Raw.
R2. Adapters removed. Short fragments deleted.
sample1_trim_report.txt  Sanity TXT.How many reads were processed and what percentage had adapters. High pairs, --pair-filter=any prevents throwing away pairs just because R1 wasn't trimmed.
